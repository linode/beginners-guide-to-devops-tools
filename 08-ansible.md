Ansible is an open-source, software provisioning tool that automates application and IT infrastructure deployment. It is lightweight and agent-less, meaning there is no client or server software to install.

See Linode's guide on **[Getting Started with Ansible](https://github.com/linode/docs/blob/471376947b9ccaaa99b0540291d96747169f8ed9/docs/guides/applications/configuration-management/ansible/getting-started-with-ansible/index.md)** for help getting started.
