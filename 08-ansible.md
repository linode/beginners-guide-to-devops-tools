Ansible is an open-source, software provisioning tool that automates application and IT infrastructure deployment. It is lightweight and agent-less, meaning there is no client or server software to install.

See Linode's guide on **[Getting Started with Ansible](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/getting-started-with-ansible/)** for help getting started.
