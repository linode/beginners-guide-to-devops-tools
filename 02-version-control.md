## Version Control

Version control, also called source control, is a system that tracks changes to code throughout the development lifecycle and maintains a record of every alteration. These systems will also store details such as authorship and timestamp along with each version.
This enables teams to compare differences or and determine problematic code sections by reviewing revision history.

*Distributed Version Control - Everyone can work concurrently or compare differences to pinpoint incompatible changes.*

Note: In recent years, version control systems have led to a branch of DevOps called “GitOps.” In GitOps, Git repositories are used as the one source of truth while traditional DevOps uses application configuration files. DevOps can be viewed as a culture while GitOps focuses more on specific tools and techniques.
