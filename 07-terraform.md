## Terraform

Terraform is an IaC tool that focuses on creating, modifying, and destroying servers and cloud resources. Not to be confused with configuration management software, Terraform does not manage the software on those servers. Any public Cloud with an API can be a provider within the Terraform lifecycle. 

Terraform simplifies cloud resource and service management with a consistent CLI and transforms cloud API calls into declarative configuration files. Terraform is a significant resource when your cloud infrastructure hits critical mass. Traditionally, anything more than a handful of servers requires an investment in a system management tool and can be difficult to maintain for smaller teams or organizations, especially when working with multiple cloud providers.

Built by HashiCorp, Terraform is a declarative tool written in Go that employs configuration files in a custom language for infrastructure management that is both human and machine-readable. Being declarative means you write code in Terraform to describe what your infrastructure should look like at the end state, or provide a blueprint of what Terraform should execute for you. Unlike an imperative tool, which would run each line of script or code to reach an outcome, a declarative tool is only concerned with the end state. Think of imperative as caring about “how” something happens while declarative only cares about “what” happens.
